Building restful services
1) 
    - It is a type of architecture (JSON over HTTP)
    - use verb approach GET, POST, DELETE ,Put etc.
    - Json is commonly used but it is not mandatory 
2)  created the product struct in productapi/data/product.go
3)  create a new hander products handler
4)  change hello handler to product handler in main.go
5)  define product list func in data/products.go
6) call the function in the handler , encode it into json and  write it using rw.Write
7)  use tags on the product struct to modify the output in the json format 

8) Now instead of using Json.Marshall we will create a different json encoding logic using io.writer 
    - because it is fast 
    - 
9) define a type inside the data/products.go for the []*Products so taht we can create a function on it instead of putting the logic inside the handler , i.e. just to make it clean


10) make necessary changes in the handler

11) that's writing Json , but how do we read Json

12) create a new Function insidethe handler get Products and put all the code of servehttp func inside it
